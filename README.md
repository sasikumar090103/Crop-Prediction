# Dataset
The data used to train the model was collected from the Crop Prediction dataset. The dataset consists of 2200 samples of 22 different crops whose predictions are made using 7 features: nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, and pH content of the soil, temperature, humidity and rainfall. The dataset is perfectly balanced, with each crop having 100 samples.

# Attributes information:

N - Ratio of Nitrogen content in soil

P - Ratio of Phosphorous content in soil

K - Ratio of Potassium content in soil

Temperature - temperature in degree Celsius

Humidity - relative humidity in %

ph - ph value of the soil

Rainfall - rainfall in mm

# Run in google colab:

STEP 1 : !git clone https://github.com/sasikumar090103/Crop-Prediction.git

STEP 2 : update the path of the Dataset in {df = pd.read_csv("YOUR FILE PATH")}
